# Django_BookHub

This project is a practising project for learning Django RestFramework using authenthication, serializers and other common tools provided in Django Framework.
You can browse the api documentation of this project through http://waiyan.pythonanywhere.com/

# About the current version

As this project is developed in my free time, currently no authenthication and testing are implemented. However, you can give suggestions for the API development to be more robust. This project will be a stepping stone for developing the larger project like studoc.com, a document sharing platform among the students from different universities.
